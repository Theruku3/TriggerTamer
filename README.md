# TriggerTamer
an App to help desensitize your pet to triggering sounds
I have a german shepherd named Bear and he is very reactive. I wanted to make a program that can help him get desensitized to specific triggering noises by either playing the noises manually and training him to be calm, or playing them automatically and letting him become desensitized by mere exposure.
There is still some bugs and the UI is a bit clunky but balancing school with making projects has been hard. Hopefully will be done this before summer 2025
